# Computer Graphics

This repository contains assignments for the **Computer Graphics (CG)** course, part of the **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** curriculum. The assignments are implemented in **C++**, demonstrating fundamental graphics algorithms and concepts.

Each `.cpp` file corresponds to a specific graphics algorithm or concept, such as:

- **Line Drawing Algorithms** (DDA, Bresenham)
- **Circle and Ellipse Drawing**
- **Polygon Filling**
- **Transformations** (Translation, Rotation, Scaling)
- **Clipping Algorithms**
- **Bezier Curves and Splines**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: OpenGL / graphics.h (depending on implementation)
- **IDE**: Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, or any C++ compatible IDE
- **Compiler**: GCC or MSVC

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the assignments:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamblesarvesh178/SemIV_CG_Assignment.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd SemIV_CG_Assignment
   ```
3. Compile and run the desired `.cpp` file using a graphics-supported environment.

> ⚠️ Note: Some programs may require legacy graphics libraries like `graphics.h`. Ensure your environment supports it or use alternatives like OpenGL.
